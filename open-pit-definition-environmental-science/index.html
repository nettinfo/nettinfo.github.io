<p>[adjective] involving the removal of the surface of a large area of land to get at a mineral or other material that is near to the surface. The structure of the mts is formed by many subsystems and elements, which are evaluated by a significant number of indicators. Surface mining is often used when there is very little ore in the rock and a lot of rock needs to be processed to obtain the ore. Underground mining and isl methods may be considered for sites that have uranium ores at deeper depths. Large ore mine to be developed in remote Russian Arctic Eye on the Arctic.</p>
