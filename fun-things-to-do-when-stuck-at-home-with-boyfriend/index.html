6 Fun Things to do With Your Kenyan Boyfriend Daily Active From dailyactive.info
Gather your housemates and make lunch or dinner an alfresco affair (without the whole being outside part, of course). It may be a gamble, especially if you’re doing it for the first time but whatever it is, it’ll probably be fun, new. Plan a day or two with your partner where you can wear clothes you don’t usually wear at home and top it off by making dinner for two. Just because you’re stuck at home, it doesn’t mean you can’t make an effort to dress up as if you’re going out.
