On a countryside walk with my son yesterday evening, we got into a discussion about my assumptions regarding social, physical interaction at work. On the one hand, new workers will need less. Put simply, when employees experience positive relationships, the body’s ability to build, maintain, and repair itself is improved both in and out of the workplace. This suggests that people develop a reserve of thinking abilities during their lives, and that this protects them against losses and harms in later life.
