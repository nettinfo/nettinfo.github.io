From zumba to rock ‘n roll classes and very good time called lights out and dance (so nobody can see you, guys), there’s so many fun classes to get your heart pumping and there’s nothing quite like a good old dance to put a smile on your face. There are a wide variety of activities and events on offer for seniors on the gold coast. Go swimming at the beach.
