Located on the edge of the buzzing el arenal resort, the park is no more than 15 minutes’ walk from our blue sea costa verde and blue sea arenal tower resorts. It wouldn’t be a holiday to costa dorada without a visit to. From the balearics to the canaries and the mainland, spain is a firm favourite among british holidaymakers with a stunning climate, glorious beaches and endless attractions all playing a part in its popularity.
