Ideas for things to do at a sleepover! sleepoverideas sleepover From pinterest.com
Not all sleepovers have to be boring and end up with everyone just whiling away the hours doing nothing fun or engaging. Whoever is up first should get a pen or pencil and sheet of paper ready in front of them and tie the blindfold around their eyes. Touch device users, explore by touch or with swipe gestures. The things that you can do with slime vary widely but the most fun things to do with it are things like seeing how far you can throw it, playing tic tac toe in it, and making things like a football out of it.
